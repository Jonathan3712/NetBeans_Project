# WEB-BASED COLLABORATIVE BIG DATA ANALYTICS ON BIG DATA

Big data describes the large volume of data both structured and unstructured data that helps a business on a day to day basis. Big data basically consists of capturing data, searching, sharing, and storing the data. Big data analytics refers to the strategy of analysing large volume of data or big data. This big data is gathered from a wide variety of sources, including social networks, videos, digital images. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently. Amazon and Flipkart are the examples of services. 

Now a days, the data has rapidly increased with cloud computing and social websites. So it is difficult to manage and process the data in traditional technologies such as relational data base and scale up infrastructure. Relational data base is designed to run on single server can not handle huge amount of data. So new collaborative big data analytics platform has introduced for more efficient services, with collaborating data owners, data scientists and service developers. 

A collaborative analytics platform is designed which focus on big data analytics software as a service. It provides all the three commonly required services, big data infrastructure as a service, big data platform as a service, big data software as a service; in a single encapsulated service named big data as a service. This project works on implementing the collaborative big data analytics on big data as a service platform.

The Documentation gives you an idea of my project and the files are the packages I used and worked on it. This project is based on netbeans technology. Thank you for reading and Happy Coding!
